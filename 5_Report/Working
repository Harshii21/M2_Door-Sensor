This is the project Door Sensor. I have used atmega328,led,voltmeter,switch and resistor. The atmega328 port C6 pin is connected to led and port B1 is 
connected  for monitoring to switch and another end of switch is connected to ground. B1 is connected to a pull-up resistor of 100 ohm.
This pull-up resistor is used so that the pins are not in floating state and another end of resistor is connected to 5 volts source.
Two voltmeters are used where one is connected between B1 port and ground and another voltmeter is connected between led and port C6.
The atmega328 is loaded with logic program and switch is considered as a Door.

  When 5v supply is given and switch is in open state the supply passes to atmega328 it is in high state then the led starts blinking. When the switch is 
  closed it becomes ground so at B1 pin the logic becomes zero and the led does not blink.
