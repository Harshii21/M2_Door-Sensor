As we know that the modern electrical automation has made the life more sophisticated,easier and economical. This project is based on automatic door sensor system
in a room or hall based on sensor. This project is applicable at such places where the people are busy and people are in large number.Therefore our project could 
be benificial from the economical point of view.
Our major goal is to provide the fully programmable automatic door sensor based on atmega328 microcontroller.
This can be used to any door for security like important wadrobe door to make sure the door has closed properly.
Sensor is a device which indicates or measure a physical property and records,indicates or otherwise responds to it.
The door sensor is an essential component which is used in security system. The designing of these sensors can be done with two parts which are arrenged in parallel 
to each other. So that the circuit can be formed. These sensor are very easy to install and portable.
There are different types of door sensor available in the market.
Most of these sensors use a reed switch and a magnet to decide the status of a door whether it is opened or closed.
